Indefinite articles are those such as English "some" or "a", which do not refer to a specific identifiable entity. Indefinites are commonly used to introduce a new discourse referent which can be referred back to in subsequent discussion: A monster ate a cookie. His name is Cookie Monster. Indefinites can also be used to generalize over entities who have some property in common: A cookie is a wonderful thing to eat. Indefinites can also be used to refer to specific entities whose precise identity is unknown or unimportant. A monster must have broken into my house last night and eaten all my cookies. A friend of mine told me that happens frequently to people who live on Sesame Street. Indefinites also have predicative uses: Leaving my door unlocked was a bad decision. Indefinite noun phrases are widely studied within linguistics, in particular because of their ability to take exceptional scope. Proper article A proper article indicates that its noun is proper, and refers to a unique entity. It may be the name of a person, the name of a place, the name of a planet, etc. The M훮ori language has the proper article a, which is used for personal nouns; so, "a Pita" means "Peter". In M훮ori, when the personal nouns have the definite or indefinite article as an important part of it, both articles are present; for example, the phrase "a Te Rauparaha", which contains both the proper article a and the definite article Te refers to the person name Te Rauparaha. The definite article is sometimes also used with proper names, which are already specified by definition (there is just one of them). For example: the Amazon, the Hebrides. In these cases, the definite article may be considered superfluous. Its presence can be accounted for by the assumption that they are shorthand for a longer phrase in which the name is a specifier, i.e. the Amazon River, the Hebridean Islands.[citation needed] Where the nouns in such longer phrases cannot be omitted, the definite article is universally kept: the United States, the People's Republic of China. This distinction can sometimes become a political matter: the former usage the Ukraine stressed the word's Russian meaning of "borderlands"; as Ukraine became a fully independent state following the collapse of the Soviet Union, it requested that formal mentions of</div>
